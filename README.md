# PowerShell Practice

This repo contains my PowerShell learning journey.  
Currently following **Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches (4th Edition, 2022)**.  

## Structure
- **lunches-2022/notes** → daily notes & concepts learned  
- **lunches-2022/snippets** → small useful commands  
- **lunches-2022/scripts** → complete scripts when they appear later in the book
